    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am someone who thrives where ambition meets execution. From the lively floors of Model United Nations conference to the strategic intensity of commerce and science competitions, I have shaped myself into a leader who thinks with logic and speaks only with intent. My journey through handling teams and organising has instilled within me the qualities of leadership, strategic thinking, marketing mindset, communication with individuals and implement them into real world scenarios. I have not only participated and won in several events but have also organised 3+ large scale events and am currently spearheading more this year with managing marketing and team dynamics. I have also lead my juniors in the right path acting as their mentor and rigorously trained them to build special qualities that will surely help them in the nearby future. I have essentially learned the value of responsibilities and accountability. I am someone who has learned the importance of balance really early in life. I feel that the balance between academics and activities outside the classroom while maintaining a reputable personality is the most important aspect of life which gives me an advantage in my social life as well. Proving that being an all-rounder isn't just a title, it's a choice I live every day.</p>
    <p>What fuels me at my core, though is technology, specifically the art of coding and the world of computers. I am fascinated by how a few lines of code can bring platforms to life, how few words of prompting can get you effective results within seconds. This passion is what's pushing me toward a future in software engineering, where i see myself not just building software but building companies. With every leadership challenge, marketing task, or debate resolution, I'm equipping myself with the skills to eventually lead in the tech-entrepreneurial world. With strong foundations in both technology and strategy, I want to move towards a career where I can come up with innovative ideas, code, lead and inspire. This is not just a dream, it is a plan in motion. </p>

    <h2>Academic Background</h2>
    <p>&rarr; Current Stream : I am currently studying at Bishop Cotton Boys' School, Bangalore, India. The subjects that I am pursuing are Physics, Chemistry, Maths and Computer Science.</p>
    <p>&rarr; In Progress and future plans : I am currently learning Java at the basic level to enhance my foundation of coding. I plan to learn HTML and CSS in the nearby future by attending courses and further enhance my coding skills. I aim to join a prompting course as well which would teach me how to effectively and rapidly get tasks done within seconds in this growing world of Artificial Intelligence.</p>
    <p>&rarr; I aspire to pursue my undergraduate degree abroad, specializing in Computer Science and Technology. I believe that an international academic environment paired with industry exposure will provide me with the ideal ecosystem to grow as a software engineer and later on build ventures of global impact. </p>

    </div>

    <h2>Passions and Strengths</h2>
    <p>&rarr; Communication: From debating to leading teams and organising events, public speaking and communication have always been my strongest suits. I have learned how to articulate thoughts cleaarly, persuade audiences, and adapt my tone to different situations, whether in formal negotiations or team meetings. This skill has not only helped me win accolades but also enabled me to lead with confidence, mentor juniors, and represent my school at high level platforms. In the tech driven world I'm entering, I believe strong communication allow me to identify the gap ideas and execution, people and systems.</p>
    <p>&rarr; Marketing: Working on sponsorships and branding for school events taught me more than just how to pitch. It taught me how to understand audiences, craft compelling value theories and align the needs of multiple stakeholders. From negotiating deals to promoting companies through digital and on-ground methods, I developed an instinct for strategic marketing that is rooted in both creativity and planning. This is a strength I plan to carry them both into my tech carrer and future entrepreneurial ventures as well.</p>
    <p>&rarr; Career Driven Strength - Adaptable problem solver and leadership in tech environments: One of my biggest strengths is adaptablity, especially when solving problems under constraints and limited resources. Whether analyzing code or resolving last minute issues during an event. I've learned how to remain calm, break down problems and deliver efficient solution without letting the audience know about the problem saving the reputation. Paired with this, my biggest strength is converting leadership skills into technical settings. I've learned how to manage teams, delegate tasks and drive outcomes. These strengths will help me in my future endeavors where leadership isn't just about managing people but about driving innovation and technical execution.</p>

    <h2>Future Endeavors and Aspirations</h2>
    <p>My future lies at the intersection of technology, leadership, and impact. I aspire to pursue a degree in Computer Science, not just to master programming languages, but to understand how digital systems can solve real-world problems. I’ve always been fascinated by how logic translates into functionality, and how a simple line of code can trigger something as dynamic as a webpage, an app, or a complete system. This amazement is what fuels my drive to become a software engineer. But for me, engineering is just the foundation, my true ambition lies in building something greater: a company, a platform, a product that changes the way people live, work, or connect. I don't see myself working in isolation. I want to lead. With my background in public speaking, team leadership, event planning, and marketing, I bring more than just technical ability to the table.</p>
    <p> I understand how to tell a story, pitch an idea, understand markets, and inspire teams. I want to build ventures that are not just functionally excellent, but also strategically positioned and human-centric. Whether it's a tech startup or a problem solving platform, I want to combine my skills in coding, marketing, and communication to create innovations that matter. Eventually, I see myself as an entrepreneur who doesn’t just follow trends, but defines them. I want to lead a team not just with authority, but with vision. I want to create value that lasts, mentor others the way I’ve been mentored, and stay rooted in learning even as I build. Every event I organize, every MUN I attend, every line of code I write, they’re all steps in that direction.</p>
    <p>I aspire to complete several courses learning Java, CSS, HTML and other coding languages. I aim to complete courses of Prompting as well which will help me bridge the gap between the understanding of AI and humans. It will help me be much more efficient and effective in my work too.</p>
